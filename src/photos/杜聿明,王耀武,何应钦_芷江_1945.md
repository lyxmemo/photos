This historic photograph was taken in Zhijiang (芷江), Hunan Province, in 1945, likely in connection with the Japanese surrender ceremony. Featured are three prominent Chinese military leaders: General Du Yuming (杜聿明), commander of the 5th Army and later the Northeast Security Command; General Wang Yaowu (王耀武), commander of the 4th Front Army known for his defensive expertise; and General He Yingqin (何应钦), Minister of War and one of the highest-ranking officials in the Chinese Nationalist government. Zhijiang holds special significance as the site where Japanese representatives formally surrendered to Chinese forces, marking the end of eight years of brutal war and the beginning of China's victory celebration.
