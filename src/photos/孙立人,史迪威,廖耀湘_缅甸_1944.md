This historical photograph captures three prominent military figures during the Burma Campaign of World War II in 1944. Featured are General Sun Li-jen (孙立人), one of China's most capable field commanders; General Joseph Stilwell (史迪威), the American commander of the China Burma India Theater; and General Liao Yaoxiang (廖耀湘), a distinguished Chinese armored corps commander. This image represents a significant moment in the Allied cooperation during the Burma Campaign, where Chinese, American, and British forces worked together to drive Japanese forces from Burma and reopen supply lines to China.
